\noindent Dear Dr. Editor,\\

\smallskip

Thank you for considering our paper  for publication.
All three referees seem to have found the work new and ``interesting'' and made suggestions for revising the presentation.
We have put these comments to use in the current version of the manuscript.
%For example, the main result -- a purely classical speed limit for deterministic dynamical systems -- appears on page 2. Page 4 is dedicated to model systems illustrating this result and how it sets the maximum amount of energy that can be dissipated by a system.
We think these improvements address the referees questions and make the paper suitable for the broad audience of your journal.
%We have added both theoretical and numerical results to demonstrate this speed limit for the dissipation of energy.

From the second report of Referee A, our presentation seems to have obscured that
% our speed limits do directly apply to any continuous deterministic systems, including those that are mixing.
%The generality of these results and that they are bounds on energy dissipation are, in part, why we feel strongly that they warrant dissemination to a broader audience.  
Referee B suggested applications to another physical system, and Referee C suggested steps to improve the presentation in the manuscript.

To address their comments, we have made considerable revisions in the current version, including:

(1) 

(2) 

(3) 

(4) 




In our view, these additions better demonstrate the broad applicability of our theory and the revisions, we believe, address the referee's concerns and make the manuscript suitable for your journal.

Please find our point-by-point responses (roman) to the referee's comments (italics) below.
