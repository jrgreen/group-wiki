	abstract={Physical systems powering motion and creating structure in a fixed amount of time dissipate energy and produce entropy. Whether living, synthetic or engineered, systems performing these dynamic functions must balance dissipation and speed. Here, we show that rates of energy and entropy exchange are subject to a speed limit---a time--information uncertainty relation---imposed by the rates of change in the information content of the system. This uncertainty relation bounds the time that elapses before the change in a thermodynamic quantity has the same magnitude as its s.d. From this general bound, we establish a family of speed limits for heat, dissipated/chemical work and entropy depending on the experimental constraints on the system and its environment. In all of these inequalities, the timescale of transient dynamical fluctuations is universally bounded by the Fisher information. Moreover, they all have a mathematical form that mirrors the Mandelstam--Tamm version of the time--energy uncertainty relation in quantum mechanics. These bounds on the speed of arbitrary observables apply to transient systems away from thermodynamic equilibrium, independent of the physical constraints on the stochastic dynamics or their function.},

	abstract = {The Boltzmann–Gibbs–Shannon (BGS) entropy Sd of a system with discrete states is inherently non-negative, and attains its minimum value of zero only when the system is known with certainty to occupy a particular state. In contrast, the BGS entropy S of a system with continuous states can be negative with no lower bound. This disparity is traced to the fact that the generalisation of Sd to obtain S is based on an implicit assumption which becomes conceptually inconsistent when the continuous probability density varies too rapidly with . This analysis suggests an alternative generalisation of Sd which results in a fully consistent and inherently non-negative entropy . The resulting expression for is observed to be algebraically equivalent to a conventional coarse-grained BGS entropy, but with the essential difference that the previously arbitrary cell sizes are now well defined and are no longer ambiguous. The non-equilibrium time dependence of is well known to be thermodynamically anomalous, whereas that of is shown to be consistent with the expected behaviour of the thermodynamic entropy and its irreversible production rate in both conservative and dissipative systems with mixing behaviour.}

Much of its phase space is occupied by regular conservative tori. Oscillator ergodicity has previously been achieved by controlling two oscillator moments with two thermostat variables. Here we use computerized searches in conjunction with visualization to find singly-thermostated motion equations for the oscillator which are consistent with Gibbs’ canonical distribution. Such models are the simplest able to bridge the gap between Gibbs’ statistical ensembles and Newtonian single-particle dynamics.}

	abstract = {Resilience is a component of ecological stability; it is assessed as the rate at
	which perturbations to a stable ecological system decay. The most frequently used estimate
	of resilience is based on the eigenvalues of the system at its equilibrium. In most cases, this
	estimate describes the rate of recovery only asymptotically, as time goes to infinity.
	However, in the short term, perturbations can grow significantly before they decay, and
	eigenvalues provide no information about this transient behavior. We present several new
	measures of transient response that complement resilience as a description of the
	response to perturbation. These indices measure the extent and duration of transient
	growth in models with asymptotically stable equilibria. They are the reactivity (the
	maximum possible growth rate immediately following the perturbation), the maximum
	amplification (the largest proportional deviation that can be produced by any perturbation),
	and the time at which this amplification occurs. We demonstrate the calculation of these
	indices using previously published linear compartment models (two models for phosphorus
	cycling through a lake ecosystem and one for the flow of elements through a tropical rain
	forest) and a standard nonlinear predator-prey model. Each of these models exhibits
	transient growth of perturbations, despite asymptotic stability. Measures of relative stability
	that ignore transient growth will often give a misleading picture of the response to a
	perturbation.},

Nonormality is found to play a central role in determining the stability of systems governed by nonautonomous operators associated with time-dependent systems. This pivotal role of nonnormality provides a conceptual bridge by which the generalized stability theory developed for analysis of autonomous operators can be extended naturally to nonautonomous operators. It has been shown that nonormality leads to transient growth in nonautonomous systems, and this result can be extended to show further that time-dependent nonormality or nonautonomous operators is capable of sustaining this transient growth leading to asympotic instability. This general destabilizing effect associated with the time-dependent operators. Simple dynamical systems are used as examples including the parametrically destabilized harmonic oscillator, growth of errors in the Lorenz system, and the asymptotic destabilization of the quasigeostrophic three-layer model b stochastic vacillation of the zonal wind.},

A brief discussion is given of Green function techniques and of the relation between Green functions and correlation functions. A discussion of recent developments in the evaluation of partition functions concludes the first part of this article dealing with the theory of density matrix techniques. Sections 5 to 9 discuss applications. The first application is the quantum-chemical one to many-body systems in their ground state, that is, systems at absolute zero, and it is shown how the density matrix fits into the Hartree-Fock and Thomas-Fermi schemes. A brief discussion is given of the theory of diamagnetism. This is followed by a discussion of non-equilibrium processes and of Kubo's approach to transport theory. After that the polarization of beams of electrons or of photons is discussed and it is indicated how density matrix techniques can be used to treat scattering processes. Section 9 concludes this part of the paper by a brief account of density matrix theory applications to resonance and relaxation phenomena. Finally, the theory of measurement in quantum mechanics is considered.}

We cannot fully explain how the theories differ until we can derive them within a single axiomatic framework, allowing an unambiguous account of how one theory is the limit of the other. Here we derive non-relativistic quantum mechanics and classical statistical mechanics within a common framework. The common axioms include conservation of average energy and conservation of probability current. But two axioms distinguish quantum mechanics from classical statistical mechanics: an ``ontic extension'' defines a nonseparable (global) random variable that generates physical correlations, and an ``epistemic restriction'' constrains allowed phase space distributions. The ontic extension and epistemic restriction, with strength on the order of Planck's constant, imply quantum entanglement and uncertainty relations. This framework suggests that the wave function is epistemic, yet it does not provide an ontic dynamics for individual systems.},

The theory of differential forms on the phase space manifold is applied to provide a fully covariant formulation of the generalized Liouville equation. The properties of invariant volume elements are considered, and the nonexistence in general of smooth invariant measures noted. The time evolution of the generalized Gibbs entropy associated with a given choice of volume form is studied, and conditions under which the entropy is constant are discussed. For non-Hamiltonian systems on manifolds with a metric tensor compatible with the flow, it is shown that the associated metric factor is in general a time-dependent solution of the generalized Liouville equation.},

	abstract={We examine spectral operator-theoretic properties of linear and nonlinear dynamical systems with globally stable attractors. Using the Kato decomposition, we develop a spectral expansion for general linear autonomous dynamical systems with analytic observables and define the notion of generalized eigenfunctions of the associated Koopman operator. We interpret stable, unstable and center subspaces in terms of zero-level sets of generalized eigenfunctions. We then utilize conjugacy properties of Koopman eigenfunctions and the new notion of open eigenfunctions---defined on subsets of state space---to extend these results to nonlinear dynamical systems with an equilibrium. We provide a characterization of (global) center manifolds, center-stable, and center-unstable manifolds in terms of joint zero-level sets of families of Koopman operator eigenfunctions associated with the nonlinear system. After defining a new class of Hilbert spaces, that capture the on- and off-attractor properties of dissipative dynamics, and introducing the concept of modulated Fock spaces, we develop spectral expansions for a class of dynamical systems possessing globally stable limit cycles and limit tori, with observables that are square-integrable in on-attractor variables and analytic in off-attractor variables. We discuss definitions of stable, unstable, and global center manifolds in such nonlinear systems with (quasi)-periodic attractors in terms of zero-level sets of Koopman operator eigenfunctions. We define the notion of isostables for a general class of nonlinear systems. In contrast with the systems that have discrete Koopman operator spectrum, we provide a simple example of a measure-preserving system that is not chaotic but has continuous spectrum, and discuss experimental observations of spectrum on such systems. We also provide a brief characterization of the data types corresponding to the obtained theoretical results and define the coherent principal dimension for a class of datasets based on the lattice-type principal spectrum of the associated Koopman operator.},

We adopt a new point of view which has emerged progressively in recent years, and which takes seriously into account the chaotic character of the microscopic time evolution. The emphasis is on nonequilibrium steady states rather than the traditional approach to equilibrium point of view of Boltzmann. The nonequilibrium steady states, in presence of a Gaussian thermostat, are described by SRB measures. In terms of these one can prove the Gallavotti--Cohen fluctuation theorem. One can also prove a general linear response formula and study its consequences, which are not restricted to near-equilibrium situations. At equilibrium one recovers in particular the Onsager reciprocity relations. Under suitable conditions the nonequilibrium steady states satisfy the pairing theorem of Dettmann and Morriss. The results just mentioned hold so far only for classical systems; they do not involve large size, i.e., they hold without a thermodynamic limit.},

We analyze a collection of empirical networks in a wide spectrum of disciplines and show that strong non-normality is ubiquitous in network science. Dynamical processes evolving on non-normal networks exhibit a peculiar behavior, as initial small disturbances may undergo a transient phase and be strongly amplified in linearly stable systems. In addition, eigenvalues may become extremely sensible to noise and have a diminished physical meaning. We identify structural properties of networks that are associated with non-normality and propose simple models to generate networks with a tunable level of non-normality. We also show the potential use of a variety of metrics capturing different aspects of non-normality and propose their potential use in the context of the stability of complex ecosystems. }

It is shown how the properties of relaxation toward a state of equilibrium can be derived from Liouville's equation for Hamiltonian dynamical systems. The relaxation rates can be conceived in terms of the so-called Pollicott–Ruelle resonances. In spatially extended systems, the transport coefficients can also be obtained from the Pollicott–Ruelle resonances. The Liouvillian eigenstates associated with these resonances are in general singular and present fractal properties. The singular character of the nonequilibrium states is shown to be at the origin of the positive entropy production of nonequilibrium thermodynamics. Furthermore, large-deviation dynamical relationships are obtained, which relate the transport properties to the characteristic quantities of the microscopic dynamics such as the Lyapunov exponents, the Kolmogorov–Sinai entropy per unit time, and the fractal dimensions. We show that these large-deviation dynamical relationships belong to the same family of formulas as the fluctuation theorem, as well as a new formula relating the entropy production to the difference between an entropy per unit time of Kolmogorov–Sinai type and a time-reversed entropy per unit time. The connections to the nonequilibrium work theorem and the transient fluctuation theorem are also discussed. Applications to nanosystems are described.}

	abstract={We generalize Gaspard's method for computing the $\epsilon$-entropy production rate in Hamiltonian systems to dissipative systems with attractors considered earlier by T{\'e}l, Vollmer, and Breymann. This approach leads to a natural definition of a coarse-grained Gibbs entropy which is extensive, and which can be expressed in terms of the SRB measures and volumes of the coarse-graining sets which cover the attractor. One can also study the entropy and entropy production as functions of the degree of resolution of the coarse-graining process, and examine the limit as the coarse-graining size approaches zero. We show that this definition of the Gibbs entropy leads to a positive rate of irreversible entropy production for reversible dissipative systems. We apply the method to the case of a two-dimensional map, based upon a model considered by Vollmer, T{\'e}l, and Breymann, that is a deterministic version of a biased-random walk. We treat both volume-preserving and dissipative versions of the basic map, and make a comparison between the two cases. We discuss the $\epsilon$-entropy production rate as a function of the size of the coarse-graining cells for these biased-random walks and, for an open system with flux boundary conditions, show regions of exponential growth and decay of the rate of entropy production as the size of the cells decreases. This work describes in some detail the relation between the results of Gaspard, those of of T{\'e}l, Vollmer, and Breymann, and those of Ruelle, on entropy production in various systems described by Anosov or Anosov-like maps.},

In this review we discuss analogies and differences with the usual deterministic chaos and introduce several tools for its characterization. Some examples of transitions from ordered behavior to stable chaos are also analyzed to further clarify the underlying dynamical properties. Finally, two models are specifically discussed: the diatomic hard-point gas chain and a network of globally coupled neurons.",

We propose a new definition of the limiting distribution of Lyapunov Spectrum according to which the thermodynamical limit transition is taken before the limit t→∞. The main result proven under rather general conditions gives the existence of this modified limiting distribution of Lyapunov Spectrum. }

	journal = {Journal of Physics A: Mathematical and Theoretical},
	abstract = {Sufficient conditions were recently established for the rates of thermodynamic entropy production and phase space volume contraction to be identically equal in thermostatted Hamiltonian systems in non-equilibrium steady states (Ramshaw 2017 Phys. Rev. E 96 052122). This equality has previously been interpreted as a statistical analogue of the second law of thermodynamics (SLT). However, that interpretation is unjustified because the volume contraction rate represents the production rate of the statistical entropy of the system and thermostat together, which differs in general from that of the Hamiltonian system itself. This logical lacuna is remedied by identifying two further conditions which combine with the previous conditions to imply a proper statistical analogue of the SLT. The first of these new conditions can simply be imposed a priori, whereas the second, like ergodicity and mixing, involves the asymptotic statistical properties of the dynamics as t → ∞. The latter condition seems likely to be analytically intractable in general, and therefore to require numerical investigation and confirmation in systems of practical interest.}

	abstract = {Thermodynamic laws fundamentally limit the efficiency and accuracy of living systems. To perform essential functions, from sensing to replication and locomotion, organisms consume energy and dissipate heat. The rate at which they consume energy can be bounded, in theory, by measuring all their internal variables. In practice, however, the entire system is rarely experimentally observable, and many internal states remain hidden. Here, we introduce a mathematical framework that yields optimal bounds on the energy consumption rate when only a small number of observables are available. Overcoming previous limitations, our approach discovers nonzero bounds even when the observed trajectories are time symmetric. We demonstrate the practical usefulness of this method in applications to a variety of recent experimental data. Living systems maintain or increase local order by working against the second law of thermodynamics. Thermodynamic consistency is restored as they consume free energy, thereby increasing the net entropy of their environment. Recently introduced estimators for the entropy production rate have provided major insights into the efficiency of important cellular processes. In experiments, however, many degrees of freedom typically remain hidden to the observer, and, in these cases, existing methods are not optimal. Here, by reformulating the problem within an optimization framework, we are able to infer improved bounds on the rate of entropy production from partial measurements of biological systems. Our approach yields provably optimal estimates given certain measurable transition statistics. In contrast to prevailing methods, the improved estimator reveals nonzero entropy production rates even when nonequilibrium processes appear time symmetric and therefore may pretend to obey detailed balance. We demonstrate the broad applicability of this framework by providing improved bounds on the energy consumption rates in a diverse range of biological systems including bacterial flagella motors, growing microtubules, and calcium oscillations within human embryonic kidney cells.}}
